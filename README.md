# Seasons
An app to track TV Shows (and eventually movies).

## To-Do
My current list on what I'm working on and what I plan to implement can be found [here](https://github.com/greenywd/tvapp/projects/1).

## Installation
Due to having no dependencies, installation should be fairly straightforward. However, you will need to create your own account over at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to generate an API Key before the app will be functional. Once you have your API Key, create a new string called `APIKey` either in `TMDBAPI.swift` or create a new file named `APIKey.swift`.
