# <s>Watchlist</s> <s>tvapp</s> szns
An app to track TV Shows (and eventually movies - if there's a suitable api :p).

## To-Do
My current list on what I'm working on and what I plan to implemeent can be found [here](https://github.com/greenywd/tvapp/projects/1).

## Installation
Due to having no dependencies, installation should be fairly straightforward. However, you will need to create your own account over at [thetvdb.com](https://www.thetvdb.com/) to generate an API Key before the app will be functional. Once you have your API Key, create a new string called `APIKey` either in `TVDBAPI.swift` or create a new file named `APIKey.swift`.
