# Watchlist
An app to track TV Shows (and eventually movies - if there's a suitable api :p).

## Project Requirements
- [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)

## To-Do

### - General
- [ ] Next episode - "airs in x minutes"
- [ ] Send a notification when a user defined show airs
- [ ] App icons (both on homescreen and inside the app)
- [ ] userDefaults - favourite shows
- [ ] Setup ads and iAP to remove them
- [ ] Cache images(?) - would speed up loading times a lot

### - Show View Controller
- [ ] Change 'Add' to a Star icon or similar and highlight it
- [ ] Fix layout of almost every label
- [ ] Possibly an 'actors' section
- [ ] Paged horizontal scroll view to scroll through fanart

### - Home View Controller
- [ ] Everything ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- [ ] Need to decide on layout - tableview or a more visual way (i.e posters)

### - Settings View Controller
- [ ] Everything ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- [ ] An option to prefer 720p or 1080p images in the Show View Controller
- [ ] Legal section - acknowledge libraries, tvdb, etc
